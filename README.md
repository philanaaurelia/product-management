# About
This is a list of available resources I have found helpful to break into product management as well as improve your product management skills. I purposely will keep this list small with no more than 5 links per section. I've noticed that other lists have given me decision paralysis - there were so many links! Anywho - I will try to keep these links up to date with articles that are no more than 5 years old. 

If a link happens to be more than 5 years old, but still relevant, you will see a cross (‚úù) at the end of the link.
